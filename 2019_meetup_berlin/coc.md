# CorrelAid meetup 2019 edition - Code of Conduct

The organizers of the CorrelAid meetup 2019 (2019-11-30 to 2019-12-01, CityLab Berlin) are dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof).

All attendees, speakers, and volunteers at the CorrelAid meetup 2019 are required to agree to the following code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout and expect cooperation in ensuring a safe environment for all.

We do not tolerate harassment of participants of the CorrelAid meetup in any form.

Participants engaging in harassing behavior may be sanctioned in any way organizers deem appropriate. Participants may be given a formally warning to stop the behaviour and expelled if they continue or immediately expelled from the meetup without refund.

Attendants of the CorrelAid meetup 2019 agree to refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech. Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

- offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size,
- race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices
- unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, or employment
- sustained or willful disruption of discussions, talks, or other events
- deliberate intimidation
- continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease
- unwanted photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes
- pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others
- inappropriate physical contact without consent or after a request to stop
- stalking or following
- threats of violence or incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in - self-harm
- use of sexual or discriminatory imagery, comments, or jokes
- unwelcome sexual attention
- deliberate ‘outing’ of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse
- deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names
- publication of non-harassing private communication

We prioritize marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. We will not act on complaints regarding:

- ‘reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia’
- reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you”
- communicating in a ‘tone’ you don’t find congenial
- criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions

If you are asked to stop harassing behaviour you should stop immediately, even if your behaviour was meant to be friendly or a joke, it was clearly not taken that way and for the comfort of all meetup attendees you should stop.

Finally: Take care of each other. Alert a member of the CorrelAid Core Team (below) if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or a potential violation of this Code of Conduct, even if it seems inconsequential.

### Requirements for talks

Talk slides and presentations fall under the code of conduct. Talk slides should not contain offensive of sexualised material. If this material is impossible to avoid given the topic (for example text mining of material from hate sites) the existence of this material should be noted both in the abstract and at the start of the talk.

### Need help?

We are aware that CorrelAid should have a dedicated person / team to take care of reports of violations of this code of conduct independent from the CorrelAid board / core team.
Unfortunately, we have not made this a priority in the past but we are dedicated to changing this over the course of the next months.

In the meantime, we are confident that the following members of the CorrelAid Core Team will do a good job at supporting you if you are being harassed, if you notice that someone else is being harassed, or if you have any other concerns:
