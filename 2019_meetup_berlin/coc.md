# CorrelAid meetup 2019 edition - Code of Conduct

The organizers of the CorrelAid meetup 2019 (2019-11-30 to 2019-12-01, CityLab Berlin) are dedicated to providing a harassment-free meetup experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof).

All attendees, speakers, and volunteers at the CorrelAid meetup 2019 are required to agree to the following code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout and expect cooperation in ensuring a safe environment for all.

We do not tolerate harassment of participants of the CorrelAid meetup in any form.

Participants engaging in harassing behavior may be sanctioned in any way organizers deem appropriate. Participants may be given a formally warning to stop the behaviour and expelled if they continue or immediately expelled from the meetup without refund.

Attendants of the CorrelAid meetup 2019 agree to refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech. Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

- offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, social class, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices
- unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, or employment
- sustained or willful disruption of discussions, talks, or other events
- deliberate intimidation
- continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease
- unwanted photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes
- pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others
- inappropriate physical contact without consent or after a request to stop
- stalking or following
- threats of violence or incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in - self-harm
- use of sexual or discriminatory imagery, comments, or jokes
- unwelcome sexual attention
- deliberate ‘outing’ of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse
- deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names
- publication of non-harassing private communication

We prioritize marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. We will not act on complaints regarding:

- ‘reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia’
- reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you”
- communicating in a ‘tone’ you don’t find congenial
- criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions

If you are asked to stop harassing behaviour you should stop immediately, even if your behaviour was meant to be friendly or a joke, it was clearly not taken that way and for the comfort of all meetup attendees you should stop.

Do not abuse substances in the context of this meetup. This includes alcohol. That does not mean that there won't be any alcohol (there will be!) but we expect you to drink responsibly. In particular, we expect you to be _always_ considerate and nice to the other attendants. Being under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol will not count as an excuse for harrassing behaviour.

Finally: Take care of each other. Alert a member of the CorrelAid Core Team (see below) if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or a potential violation of this Code of Conduct, even if it seems inconsequential.

### Requirements for talks

Talk slides and presentations fall under the code of conduct. Talk slides should not contain offensive of sexualised material. If this material is impossible to avoid given the topic (for example text mining of material from hate sites) the existence of this material should be noted both in the abstract and at the start of the talk.

### Need help?

We are aware that CorrelAid should have a dedicated person / team independent of the CorrelAid board / core team to take care of reports of violations of this code of conduct.
Unfortunately, we have not made this a priority in the past but we are dedicated to changing this over the course of the next months.

In the meantime, we will compose an awareness team consisting of members of the CorrelAid Core Team. The team members in charge will wear special stickers during the event. Details will be announced at the offical welcome on Saturday morning. Please speak to one of them if you are being harassed, if you notice that someone else is being harassed, or if you have any other concerns.

If you are uncomfortable to speak to us in person, if you are not able to find someone to talk to or if you want to let us know something after the meetup has ended, you can write an email to one of the following people:

- Frie: [frie.p@correlaid.org](mailto:frie.p@correlaid.org).
