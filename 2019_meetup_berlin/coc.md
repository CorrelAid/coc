# CorrelAid meetup 2019 edition - Code of Conduct

The organizers of the CorrelAid meetup 2019 (2019-11-30 to 2019-12-01, CityLab Berlin) are dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof).

All attendees, speakers, and volunteers at the CorrelAid meetup 2019 are required to agree to the following code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout and expect cooperation in ensuring a safe environment for all.

We do not tolerate harassment of participants of the CorrelAid meetup in any form.

Participants engaging in harassing behavior may be sanctioned in any way organizers deem appropriate. Participants may be given a formally warning to stop the behaviour and expelled if they continue or immediately expelled from the meetup without refund.

Attendants of the CorrelAid meetup 2019 agree to:

- Be considerate in speech and actions, and actively seek to acknowledge and respect the boundaries of fellow attendees.
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech. Harassment includes, but is not limited to:
- unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, or employment
- continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease
- deliberate ‘outing’ of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse
- Stalking
- Deliberate intimidation
- Unwanted photography or recording
- Discriminatory images in public spaces
- Sustained or willful disruption of talks or other events
- Use of sexual or discriminatory imagery, comments, or jokes
- Offensive verbal comments related to gender and gender expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, or technology choices.
- Inappropriate physical contact without consent or after a request to stop, which can include grabbing as well as hugging without asking or massaging without asking
- Unwelcome sexual attention, which can include inappropriate questions of a sexual nature, asking for sexual favours or repeatedly asking for dates or contact information
- Alert a member of the staff if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this code of conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

We prioritize marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. We will not act on complaints regarding:

- ‘reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia’
- reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you”
- communicating in a ‘tone’ you don’t find congenial
- criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions

If you are asked to stop harassing behaviour you should stop immediately, even if your behaviour was meant to be friendly or a joke, it was clearly not taken that way and for the comfort of all conference attendees you should stop.

### Requirements for talks

Talk slides and presentations fall under the code of conduct. Talk slides should not contain offensive of sexualised material. If this material is impossible to avoid given the topic (for example text mining of material from hate sites) the existence of this material should be noted both in the abstract and at the start of the talk.

### Need help?

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact Frie Preu.
